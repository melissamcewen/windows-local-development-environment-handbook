# Local Development Environment On Windows Handbook
It all started one day when I got a new job and they handed me a Windows computer. For the past 9 years I'd mainly been developing on Linux and Mac, so I was a bit apprehensive. This handbook is a hopefully a useful document, but also a record of my attempts. So far it honestly hasn't been going well. I feel like I'm spending more time on my development environment than on developing. I've developed a healthy hatred for Windows file systems. 

# Goals
Well I do basically everything. I'll full stack. I work on PHP, Javascript (Angular and Node) mostly, some Ruby on Rails. I do a ton of Drupal projects. I'd like my local development environment to be portable, fast and you know, actually work.
